### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Subham
#### CSE Junior at IIT Ropar

I am keenly interested in Deep Learning and Software Development. Since my first year, I contributed significantly to open-source deep learning projects, which gave me hands-on experience building innovative and efficient AI solutions to solve real-world problems. I have also designed multiple websites(full-stack) in different hackathons addressing problem statements from diverse domains. I am familiar with react JS, node JS, firebase, flask, and Django.

I also have previous research experience in autonomous UAV tracking using neural networks(CNN-LSTMs) and reinforcement learning. I enjoy participating in competitions and have led my team to victory in multiple national-level AI hackathons. I also love to work on data analytics and business case studies.
