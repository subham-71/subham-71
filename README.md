### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Subham
#### CSE Junior at IIT Ropar

I am keenly interested in the AI space. Since my first year, I contributed significantly to open-source projects where I built end-to-end machine learning and deep learning models and created CI-CD pipelines for deployment using Azure MLOps. I am currently interning at DataOrb.ai as an NLP intern where I am working on transformer models for topic segmentation and deep learning-based NER approaches. I also have previous research experience in autonomous UAV tracking using deep learning (CNN-LSTMs) based computer vision techniques and reinforcement learning.

I have also led my institute to victory in multiple national-level software and AI hackathons. Apart from my interest in AI, I have also designed multiple websites(full-stack) in different hackathons addressing problem statements from diverse domains. I am familiar with react JS, node JS, firebase, flask, and Django.
